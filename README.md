# UFOs
Using Javascript and other customization tools (including Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS) to capture UFO sightings.

## Overview
For this project we worked with a client to display a UFO data table that is stored as a JavaScript array. We also created a dynanmic website by giving the table the ability to filter by multiple criteria. Next, we used Javascript functions to loop through the data to build the table and create a customized dashboard. This site will record the information when an element has changed and develop an interactive webpage. 

## Results 
Our resulting web page displayed below.

Displayed in our webpage is the
**Date
**Location
**UFO shapes
**Witness comments

Visitors to our webpage can use the filter search section to find specific instances of the information above. 

## Summary 

While the page is funtional and organized, we can see the page has several drawbacks. 

Such as:

* Case Sensitivity: The search field is "case-sensitive". You will need to enter the info exactly how the data is stored this includes spaces.
* Partial Entries: This site unfortunately does not allow for partial entries. This can cause problems for the user because it does not intuitively tell them how the information should be entered other than the "default" example shown. 
* Action Button: There is no action button, wording or trigger that tells the user that the table will update after you hit "enter".
* Limited Data: The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

## Recommendations

We can easilily improve our site by adding the below features.

* We can add additional customizations, such as action-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.

* Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data. This allows opportunities to expand our search from only the United States to a global platform.

* Add a section that can show the most recent reported sighting.
